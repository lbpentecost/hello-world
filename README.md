# hello-world

Hello Peeps,

My name is Luke. I am trying to get back into the programming world of things since I was in college, about four years ago. I graduated with a Physics degree and Mathematics minor. I really enjoyed turning physics into the programming world and created many different programs that did essentially that. After I graduated I ended up getting a job that didn't use any of this information. Now I'm trying to get back into the field again. A lot of things have changed in programming, so here I am. I am going for it!

Thanks, 

Luke!
